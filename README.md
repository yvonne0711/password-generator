## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learnt
- Functions throughoug the whole file
- Prompting the user for password length but didn't manage to figure out how to give more options incorporated into the rest of the code
- Used the property `Math.floor` and `Math.random`
- Merged the characters together using the method [`.concat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)
- Used a [`for` loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) to iterate through each password character
- Given code for functionality of generating a password on-click of a button
- A difficult challenge using JavaScript with many functions needed
